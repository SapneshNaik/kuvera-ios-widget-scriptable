# Setup:

First, you should add the __kuvera_ios_widget.js__ Script to Scriptable. Either copy the content of the __kuvera_ios_widget.js__ file and paste it into a new script in Scriptables or download the file and add it to your iCloud Drive Scriptables folder in iCloud Drive (Files App)

1. Enter "Wiggle Mode" on your homescreen and tap on the __+__ symbol
2. Search for and/or tap on Scriptable
3. Choose one of three sizes and tap __+ Add Widget__
4. Tap on the new widget while still in "Wiggle Mode" or long press on the widget and tap "Edit Widget"
5. Click on __Choose__ next to __Script__
6. Choose __kuvera_ios_widget__ from the list
7. Tap anywhere outside of the config window and you're done! The widget should now load.
